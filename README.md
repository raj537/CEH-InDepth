# CEH-InDepth
This  Project is an initiative for  bringing the CEH concepts in a easy and in-depth approach..
---------------------------------
## Starting with Chapter 3 (Previous Chapters will be covered as well)
### Gathering Host Information: Scanning and Enumeration

#### First Lets Understand what Scanning is ?
`<p>After The Reconnaissance and Information-gathering stages have been completed, the next phase that comes is Scanning .Scanning is the process of locating systems that are alive and responding on the network.Ethical hackers use scanning to identify target systemsâ€™ IP addresses. In Scanning Host Information like live hosts , open ports , etc.. are gathered </p>`
----------------------------
#### WHY WE NEED SCANNING?
`<p>Well, the Answer is simple before launching a successfull attack the hacker needs enough information  about the target server , and open ports and the services running on those ports are most important information that a hacker needs ( In black-box test).Sometimes vulnerable services are running on ports , or may be a port is configured with default vulnerable settings , in these scenarios a efficient scan can provide a easy-way in for the hacker.. </p>`
------------------------------------------------
#### TYPES OF SCANNING
##### There are three types of Scanning:
       * Port Scanning 
       * Network Scanning
       * Vulnerability Scanning
